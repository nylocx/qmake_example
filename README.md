# qmake_example
Example project to show the usage of qmake.

I created this project because I was often asked how to create a Qt project with qmake that has more then
a single target. And as the Qt documentation is a little sparse on that topic I created this commented minimal
example.
There are still some features missing that I will try to add from time to time.

If you have any suggestions how to make this example clearer/better just file an issue or even better
provide a pull request that I can incorporate.
